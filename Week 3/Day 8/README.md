Today we had a meeting about our homework. We were showing each other how everyone came up with the solution to that. Everyone got the authorization part and a little bit of friends’ list. Furthermore, if someone had a question we tried to help him or gave the advise. Also, we were thinking about how to implement the messages in our project. Then, some of us showed cool libraries that we can use and to make our code easy to run. Nevertheless, some of us don’t think that we will get it done in time. However, we’ll try our best!
