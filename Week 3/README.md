HW 6

```
Part 1. Create your own Django project. It must be your own portfolio website. You should have at least two apps: blog and portfolio. You must be able to add blog entries and portfolio works from admin panel, and the result must be shown on your website.

Part 2. Visit mathforces.com. It is given that website was developed using pure django. Imagine that you were the one who coded it. Explain to intermediate python developer how you did that.
