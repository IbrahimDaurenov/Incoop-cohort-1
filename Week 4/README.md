HW 6 (Deadline: August 3)

```
Part 1. Create your own Django project. It must be your own portfolio website. You should have at least two apps: blog and portfolio. You must be able to add blog entries and portfolio works from admin panel, and the result must be shown on your website.

Part 2. Visit mathforces.com. It is given that website was developed using pure django. Imagine that you were the one who coded it. Explain to intermediate python developer how you did that.
```

HW 7 (Deadline: August 8)

```
  Build a Web application that connects businesses and customers. It is your choice on which businesses you may want to choose, but the main criteria is to give businesses to give a chance to add (AND CUSTOMIZE!!!) their products (or services) using your platform and customers to buy/order some products/services. At every moment businesses must be able to see all their products (and, of course, customize them), add new products/services, delete products/services, view orders from users. Users, on the other hand, must be able to check all available options on market, buy/order some of them and view history of all previous orders.

  Some of the examples to get inspiration from: Wolt/Glovo, Uber/Yandex.Taxi, Chocolife, Krisha. But you can create any other B2C connection website.
