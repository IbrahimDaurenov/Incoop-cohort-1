## Homework 3 (by July 22):
```
Ex. 1: You need to write a program, that will ask a user to type a name of some country. If this country is in top-25 (by the size) then you should print 'Asia' or 'America' or 'Africa', you should print the link to wikipedias link. You are not allowed to use ANY libraries (exception: webbrowser if you want extra-credit). Try to use data-types covered in Day 4.

Ex 2. Write a python program that validates the password. First of all, ask for a password. Then check if:

 - It has at least one lower case letter
 - It has at least one upper case letter
 - It has at least one digit
 - It has at least one special character
 - It has at least 10 characters
 - It has at most 15 characters

If password passes validity test then say 'Success' to user. Otherwise, ask to retype password until they type valid password.

Ex 3.
Write a program that will print letter "A" in a fancy way. Ask user for a size (integer number from 0 to 30) and type fancy A with the given size based on examples. Below you can find examples of how it must be printed:

If size = 1:
 *
***
* *

If size = 2:
 **
*  *
****
*  *
*  *

If size = 3:
 ***                                                                   
*   *                                                                  
*   *                                                                  
*****                                                                  
*   *                                                                  
*   *                                                                  
*   *



Ex 4.
Create Github repo and call it "Web Development Practice"
Upload HW1, HW2 and HW3 (in separate folders).
```

## Homework 4 (by July 24):
```
  Ex 1. Create your own cypher (call it cypher.py). You should ask your user to choose if he wants to encrypt or decrypt message. If he chooses to encrypt then ask for the message and then send him encrypted message. Otherwise, allow your to decrypt the message that he has got.

  Ex 2. Create a game (guess.py). Program should randomly generate a number between 1 and 10000 and user must guess this number. After each guess computer should respond with either: 'My number is greater', 'My number is less' or 'You guessed my number'.

  Ex 3. Create a program (time_machine.py) that asks user some date. After user typed the date your program should print either 'This date was N days ago' or 'This date will be in N days'. Make sure your program can understand all following inputs (without asking for some specific type): DD/MM/YYYY, DD.MM.YYYY, DD/MM/YY, DD.MM.YY, DD,MM,YY, DD.MM.YYYY

  Ex 4. Create a program hw4.py that will ask me to choose which exercise I want to grade. For example, if I choose Ex3, it should run time_machine.py.

```

## Homework 5 / Project 1 (by July 31):
```

You need to develop social media network. User should have opportunity to:
- Register (login, password)
- Login (login, password)

Once your user is registered/loged he/she must be able to:
- Search for other users (by login)
  - send a friend request
  - If already friends then send a message
- View all friends (list of all friends logins)
- View all friend requests
  - Accept or decline them
- View all unread messages
  - Open one of them
- View last 5 inbox messages
- View last 5 sent messages
- Sign out / Exit
```
