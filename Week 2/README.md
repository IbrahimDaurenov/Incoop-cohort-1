## Homework 3 (by July 22):
```
Ex. 1: You need to write a program, that will ask a user to type a name of some country. If this country is in top-25 (by the size) then you should print 'Asia' or 'America' or 'Africa', you should print the link to wikipedias link. You are not allowed to use ANY libraries (exception: webbrowser if you want extra-credit). Try to use data-types covered in Day 4.

Ex 2. Write a python program that validates the password. First of all, ask for a password. Then check if:

 - It has at least one lower case letter
 - It has at least one upper case letter
 - It has at least one digit
 - It has at least one special character
 - It has at least 10 characters
 - It has at most 15 characters

If password passes validity test then say 'Success' to user. Otherwise, ask to retype password until they type valid password.

Ex 3.
Write a program that will print letter "A" in a fancy way. Ask user for a size (integer number from 0 to 30) and type fancy A with the given size based on examples. Below you can find examples of how it must be printed:

If size = 1:
 *
***
* *

If size = 2:
 **
*  *
****
*  *
*  *

If size = 3:
 ***                                                                   
*   *                                                                  
*   *                                                                  
*****                                                                  
*   *                                                                  
*   *                                                                  
*   *
